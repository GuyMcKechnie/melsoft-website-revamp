# Documentation: Website Revamp Changes

This document outlines the changes made to the Blackrock Utility Company website. The original website was analyzed and revamped using basic HTML and Bootstrap CSS to create a modern, responsive, and user-friendly experience.

## 1. Modern and Responsive Design with Bootstrap

The revamped website is built with Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites. This ensures that the website will look great and function correctly on all devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones. The original website's layout was more rigid, while the new design is fluid and adapts to different screen sizes.

## 2. Improved Navigation

A new, streamlined navigation bar has been implemented using Bootstrap's navbar component. It provides clear links to the "Our Services" and "Contact Us" sections, allowing users to easily find the information they need.

## 3. Clearer Structure and Visual Hierarchy

The revamped website has a more organized and intuitive structure:

-   **Hero Section**: A prominent hero section at the top of the page with a background image immediately grabs the user's attention and communicates the company's value proposition.
-   **Services Section**: The services are now presented in a clean and organized card-based layout with Font Awesome icons, making them easy to read and visually appealing.
-   **Contact Section**: The contact form and contact information are now presented side-by-side in a dedicated "Contact Us" section with a clean, modern design.

## 4. Enhanced User Experience

The new design is more user-friendly and provides a better overall experience. The clear structure, responsive design, improved navigation, and visual icons all contribute to a more intuitive and enjoyable browsing experience for potential customers.

## 5. Organized and Maintainable Code

The website is built with basic HTML and Bootstrap, making it lightweight and easy to maintain. Custom styling has been moved to an external CSS file (`styles.css`) for better organization and maintainability. Font Awesome icons have been integrated to enhance the visual appeal of the services section.

## 6. Key Features Added

-   External CSS file for better code organization
-   Hero section with background image and overlay
-   Font Awesome icons for service categories
-   Responsive card layout for services
